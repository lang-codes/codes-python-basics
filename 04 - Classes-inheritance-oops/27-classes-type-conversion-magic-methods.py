# Type conversion magic methods

# Python also has an array of magic methods designed to implement behavior for built in type conversion functions like float(). Here they are:

# __int__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to int.
# __long__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to long.
# __float__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to float.
# __complex__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to complex.
# __oct__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to octal.
# __hex__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to hexadecimal.
# __index__(self)
#     Implements type conversion to an int when the object is used in a slice expression. If you define a custom numeric type that might be used in slicing, you should define __index__.
# __trunc__(self)
#     Called when math.trunc(self) is called. __trunc__ should return the value of `self truncated to an integral type (usually a long).
# __coerce__(self, other)
#     Method to implement mixed mode arithmetic. __coerce__ should return None if type conversion is impossible. Otherwise, it should return a pair (2-tuple) of self and other, manipulated to have the same type.
